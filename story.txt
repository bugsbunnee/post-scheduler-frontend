The Last Message
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting fiery hues across the sky, Mia stood alone on the beach, clutching a small glass bottle in her hand. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded tightly, the ink barely dry.

She had found the bottle washed ashore one week earlier. Its original message was simple but haunting:

"If you find this, know that I am lost but hopeful. Tell someone your story before it’s too late. —T"

Mia’s life had been quiet, even lonely. An avid reader and writer, she spent her days at the local library and her nights dreaming of far-off places. But that message—simple as it was—planted a seed in her heart. She hadn’t told her own story to anyone.

Tonight, she would change that.

Mia slid her note into the bottle. She’d spent hours crafting it, sharing her dreams, fears, and a wish to inspire whoever might read it. She sealed the bottle tight and hurled it into the waves, watching it bounce and disappear into the ocean’s embrace.

Days turned to weeks, and the bottle became a faint memory. Life carried on.

Months later, Mia found a package on her doorstep with no return address. Inside was the bottle, her note carefully unfolded and accompanied by another letter:

"Dear Mia,
I am T. Your story reached me when I needed it most. It reminded me to have hope. I’m returning your message with one of my own: Keep sharing your story—it changes more lives than you realize.
With gratitude, T."

Mia smiled, tears pooling in her eyes. The cycle of stories, she realized, was as endless as the tides.

And it had just begun.
